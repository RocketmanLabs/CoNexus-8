| Inquiry | CoNexus sessions are organized around Inquiries. Inquiries contain their Group(s), TopicLists, Evaluations, and Results. | |
| Participant | A Contact that has accepted an invitation to participate. | |
| Topic | A single idea, strategy or goal (TopicList), or a single scenario or alternate plan (Criterions). | Between 8 and 20 TopicList are recommended (minimum = 2); Criterions can have 1-n entries. |
| TopicList | A list of Topics to be used in Evaluations. | Each Inquiry is based primarily around two lists: 1) Criterions or scenarios; 2) TopicList (a.k.a. strategies, goals, etc. | |

... developed when all participants were together in one place.  This is called a **Same Time/Same Place** (STSP) session, and there are three others:

1. **Same Time / Different Place** - STDP sessions create opportunities for participants to play off one another, increasing team cohesion (one hopes) while allowing for participation regardless of geography.

2. **Different Time/Same Place** - DTSP sessions usually involve a kiosk or shared console of some sort, and are most useful for raw data collection processes such as surveys.

3. **Different Time/Different Place** - DTDP sessions offer geographic and temporal freedom, and are often the default choice for Facilitators.

## Inquiry Structure
A typical STSP CoNexus session consisted of a network of participant-response devices and a shared screen.  The screen presented Topics for all participants to evaluate in various ways. 

Participants voted at the same time, as choices were presented on the shared screen. When evaluation was complete, results were displayed.

An Inquiry consists of the following elements:
1. A group of participants
2. A list of Alternatives or scenarios. All Inquiries an Alternatives collection with at least one entry, called "Current".
3. A list of 8-20+ criteria (Topics), strategies, or goals.
4. An Evaluation protocol, consisting of:
> a. Paired comparison voting (also called forced choice) where every Topic (criteria) is compared to every other one.  This yields the Importance axis of the results.
> b. A survey yielding the Performance or Satisfaction axis of the results.
> c. Other data collection, including participant demographics, as required.

The Evaluation step is repeated for each defined Axis. After all Axes have been evaluated, results can be shown.  

Results display the data from evaluation in ways designed to promote discussion of shared goals and key differences.  The Profile is one such visualization. 
> a. The main Profile shows each criteria plotted according to its average Importance and Performance scores.
> b. Individual Profiles show where each individual voted. They are often delivered to each participant along with the main Profile to show where they voted.
> c. Consensus Profiles show (anonymously) where each participant voted on each single TopicList.  These profiles represent the agreement in the group on priorities and performance.

As you will see in the History section, refining the CoNexus design took place over nearly twenty years, but was halted before the widespread use of the internet and the development of modern mobile devices.

In this version of CoNexus, the mobile network takes the place of the custom keypads, and the phone screen is the shared screen that participants can work on at their own rate.

## History

Dr. George Land is credited with the initial vision that led to CoNexus. He saw it as a way to automate a manual strategic process that he developed while consulting on the divestiture of the Bell companies in 1982.

CoNexus was developed by Tom McNamee in response to that vision. The initial version was an MS-DOS program working with custom-designed keypads on a bespoke network to capture participant responses. Russ Magnuson was responsible for keypad & network design, production and support.

In the early 1990's, McNamee ported CoNexus to Windows 3.1, followed by NT, Windows 7, and finally Windows 8.1.
